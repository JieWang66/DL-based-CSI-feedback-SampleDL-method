Abstract of Paper: 

Accurate downlink channel state information (CSI)
is required to be fed back to the base station (BS) in frequency
division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems in order to achieve maximum antenna diversity
and multiplexing. However, downlink CSI feedback overhead
scales with the number of transceiver antennas, a major hurdle
for practical deployment of FDD massive MIMO systems.
To solve this problem, we propose a compressive sampled
CSI feedback method based on deep learning (SampleDL).
In SampleDL, the massive MIMO channel matrix is sampled
uniformly in time/frequency dimension before being fed into
neural networks (NNs), which will reduce the computational
resource/time at user equipment (UE) as well as enhance the
CSI recovery accuracy at the BS. Both theoretical analysis and
normalized mean square errors (NMSE) results confirm the
advantages of the proposed method in terms of time complexity
and recovery accuracy. Besides, a suitable CSI feedback period
is explored by link level simulations, which aims to further
reduce the overhead of CSI feedback without degrading the
communication quality.

How to use this simulation code package?

1、Run C_D_Net_1vs336_test_v60.py first to obtain the sample CSI recovered at BS.
2、The run R_Net_1vs336_test_v60.py you will get the performance of the SampleDL method in Fig. 9 when the compress rate is 1/336, 
and the dataset is generated when the velocity of the UE is 60km/h.
3、The number of test samples is 10000. If the data size exceeds your computer's memory, you can reduce the number of test samples.
4、The test data is given in https://share.weiyun.com/8t0z5BFP.

Note: As written in our paper, "The training data and testing data are generated by utilizing a link-level simulation for the 5G NR Release 15 of MATLAB, 
which simulates the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) throughputs of a 5G NR link [32]." The dataset is too large to upload to Github.

Enjoy the reproducible research!
